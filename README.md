# ASK THE CATERPILLAR

This is a WIP backend that will initially interface with IBM's Watson Conversation engine and the Psychonaut Wiki to provide an agnostic endpoint for chatbots to send a question about substances and receive an answer.

Not much is here or working yet...readme will be updated as it is!
