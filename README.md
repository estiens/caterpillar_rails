# ASK THE CATERPILLAR

Ask The Caterpillar is a harm reduction chatbot that allows people easy access to information about substances so that they can make informed choices.

https://www.askthecaterpillar.com

Currently it builds substance models using information from [TripSit](https://tripsit.me/) and [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page).  It uses [RecastAI](https://recast.ai) for natural language processing and for interfacing with Slack, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, and Twilio(SMS). It also has an endpoint that can take a query and respond with a message, for building chatbots on top of it.

Next steps:
* Tests
* Train models on incoming input
* Decide on what additional information to add
